## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Ruby (version 3.2.2)
- Rails (version 7.1.2)
- PostgreSQL (version 9.3+)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kylebowen/local-weather.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd local-weather
   ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

6. [OPTIONAL] Create the database and run migrations:

   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

7. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

   Add the following content to the `.env` file:

   ```dotenv
   GEOCODER_API_KEY=<your_geocoder_api_key>
   OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=<your_open_weather_api_key>
   ```

   Replace `<your_geocoder_api_key>` and `<your_open_weather_api_key>` with your actual API keys.

8. Run the specs:

   ```bash
   bin/rspec
   ```

6. [OPTIONAL] Enable local caching:

   ```bash
   rails dev:cache
   ```
   Disable local caching by running the same command again. The server will restart itself.

7. Start the Rails server:

   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
